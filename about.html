        In our short life which almighty gave us, we all human beings try to do many things for ourselves, our family and for our society where we live.

There are many ways to contribute such as doing social service, providing food, providing money, etc. However, the thought came these are all perishable and would not be enough for what society has given us in all our life.
After much thought process, we felt that building a small mandir would help in some small way and thus help us realize the purpose of our life of being an human.

With this thought we approached our Dharma Acharya <u style="color: red;">His Holiness Sri Sri Sri Tridandi Srimannarayana Ramanuja Chinnajeeyar swami</u> who in turn encouraged us to build mandir of Lord Venkateshwara fondly called Balaji in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. He guided us to approach <u style="color: red;"> DNV Prasadgaru (Chief Architect of Sri Ramanuja Sahasrabdi project)</u> for the design of the mandir and the main deity. The unique thing about the deity is that the main deity is Eka Shila murthy means it is made up of one single stone and it is made in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh where the popular temple of Lord Venkateshwara is located in between 7 hills place called Tirumala.

There were many obstacles which came along in between, however with mangalasasanams of our Acharya finally the mandir was completed in May 2021. Once completed we approached our Acharya to grace the Pranapratishta of Lord Balaji and by grace of almighty the Pranapratisha of Lord Balaji was done by our Acharya His Holiness Sri Sri Sri Tridandi Srimannarayana Ramanuja Chinnajeeyar swami on 09.08.2021 at 1.30 pm. It was the first day of Shravan masam as per telugu calender and it a same auspicious day of magha nakshatra on which Lord Balaji has graced his presence in Tirumala.

Every day the mandir is opened at 7.30 am with chanting of Suprabhatam followed by Bala bhogam at 8.30 am, Raja bhogam in afternoon at 12.30 pm and evening bhogam at 8.30 pm. At these times prasadam is being served to all the present devotees.

The Balaji mandir opening timings are from :

Morning 07.30 am to 12.30 pm and
Evening 04.30 pm to 08.30 pm

We request all devotees to pay visit to the temple along with their friends, relatives and colleagues and share their greviances and joy with Lord Balaji. Lord Balaji will definitely provide His guidance as per their wishes.

<u style="color: red;">Jai Srimannarayana ! Om Namo Venkatesaya !</u>
